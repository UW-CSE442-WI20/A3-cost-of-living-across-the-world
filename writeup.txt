QUESTION: Which city has the most expensive costs for living for a single person?

A rationale for your design decisions.
How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques?
What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices?
We decided to make our visualization a map with a filter that allows that user to pick which types of expenses to compare
to see which city has the most expensive cost of living. Each city on the map will have a circle of a certain size, which
will tell the reader how expensive it is to live there. The larger the circle, the more expensive it is. We also decided
to add a list of the top most expensive cities to live in next to the map, so that it is clearer for the user.
We also considered using different color shades to express cost as well for the circles on the map but we realized that it
would be redundant and decided just to use size. Another thing we considered was to use a bar graph but there were too many
categories and cities to include, that we decided to show all the cities in a map and reduce the number of categories by only
selecting a few with the filter.
